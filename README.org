This program calculates the total and exclusive data set for btrfs subvolumes.

It works by iterating every subvolume, and then every extent, and keeping track of the extents that the subvolume references. This operation is *very* slow.

* usage

After building with ~cargo build~, put the resulting binary on ~$PATH~ or use ~cargo run~ to run the program.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo btrfs-subvol-size --root=/
#+END_SRC

* todo
Make an ebuild to install the program "properly".
